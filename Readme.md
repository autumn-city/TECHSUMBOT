# Answer Summarization for Technical Queries: Benchmark and New Approach
This repository contains the code, pre-trained models, and Stack Overflow summarization benchmark for our paper: "Answer Summarization for Technical Queries: Benchmark and New Approach".
# Quick Link
# Overview
We construct the first summarization benchmark named TechSumBench for answer summarization of technical queries in SQA sites. 
The following figure is an illustration of our benchmark construction.
